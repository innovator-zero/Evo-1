# RoboTwin Evaluation for Evo-1

Full setup and run instructions live in the top-level
[README → 🧪 RoboTwin Benchmark](../README.md#-robotwin-benchmark).

This directory ships the Evo-1 **policy plugin** for RoboTwin:

```
policy/Evo1/
  deploy_policy.py   # RoboTwin policy interface: obs -> server -> smoothed 14-D action chunk
  deploy_policy.yml  # default config (horizon=37)
  eval.sh            # single-task launcher
```

Install it into a RoboTwin checkout:

```bash
cp -r policy/Evo1  /path/to/RoboTwin/policy/Evo1
```

The Evo-1 server reads `arm_key` / `dataset_key` from each client request, so **no server-side
edit is needed for RoboTwin** — the client sends `arm_key=aloha_joint` and the per-task
`dataset_key=robotwin_<task>` (RoboTwin `norm_stats.json` is keyed per task, 50 keys under
`aloha_joint`).

For checkpoints trained on
[StarVLA/RoboTwin-Randomized](https://huggingface.co/datasets/StarVLA/RoboTwin-Randomized),
`norm_stats.json` is keyed per task **and per data setting** (`robotwin_<task>_clean` /
`robotwin_<task>_rand`, 100 keys). Pass `auto` as the 8th argument of `eval.sh`
(`dataset_key_suffix`) and the client appends the suffix matching the task config
(`demo_clean` → `_clean`, `demo_randomized` → `_rand`).

## Inference Settings

The policy is served with:

1. **`horizon=37`** — actions executed per inference call (default in `eval.sh` / `deploy_policy.yml`).
2. **`num_inference_timesteps=50`** in `Evo_1/scripts/Evo1_server.py`.
3. **Gaussian action smoothing, kernel=9** — in `deploy_policy.py`.

## Results — RoboTwin-50 (clean-only training)

A **single multi-task policy trained on clean data only** — 50 RoboTwin tasks,
**50 `demo_clean` demonstrations per task** (no randomized / augmented data). At **test time**
each task is rolled out **100 times per setting** (50 tasks × 100 = 5000 evaluation episodes
per setting), `horizon=37`, using the released `MINT-SJTU/Evo1_RoboTwin` checkpoint.

| Setting | Overall success rate |
|---|---|
| `demo_clean` | **65.7%** (3287 / 5000) |
| `demo_randomized` (zero-shot) | **12.5%** (623 / 5000) |

The `demo_randomized` number is **zero-shot domain generalization** — the policy never saw
randomized scenes (messy table, random background / lighting, table-height jitter) during
training. See the RoboTwin-550 section below for the effect of training on randomized data.

## Results — RoboTwin-550 randomized training (`demo_clean` + `demo_randomized`)

A **single multi-task policy trained on randomized data** — the public
[StarVLA/RoboTwin-Randomized](https://huggingface.co/datasets/StarVLA/RoboTwin-Randomized)
dataset: the same 50 RoboTwin tasks, **550 demonstrations per task** (50 `demo_clean` +
500 `demo_randomized`), 27,500 demonstrations in total. At **test time** each task is rolled
out **100 times per setting** (2 × 50 × 100 = 10,000 evaluation episodes), `horizon=37`,
`dataset_key_suffix=auto`. Checkpoint release in preparation.

| Setting | Overall success rate |
|---|---|
| `demo_clean` | **85.0%** (4251 / 5000) |
| `demo_randomized` | **83.2%** (4161 / 5000) |
